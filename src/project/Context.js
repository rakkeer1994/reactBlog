It was launched on Thursday evening globally and in the next few days, it is reaching various markets. In India, the OnePlus 10 Pro will be on open sale from April 5, while the early sale and pop-up sales will start a day or two early. Now that the phone is here, the question is: Is it any good? And the short answer is plenty. In fact, as we found in our detailed OnePlus 10 Pro review, the OnePlus 10 Pro is arguably the flagship phone you should buy in India right now.That detailed review, however, is rather long. We covered a lot of it, taking a thorough look at the OnePlus 10 Pro's performance, its camera system, its display and its key features. You may not have enough time to read the entire thing. So, here is a quick summary of the OnePlus 10 Pro review at 5 points. Point 1: Let's start with the best part of the OnePlus 10 Pro: its camera system. Termed 2nd-Gen collab between OnePlus and Hasselblad, the OnePlus 10 Pro camera system delivers excellent performance for most parts and plenty of useful tricks and features. In our review, we found that the OnePlus 10 Pros main camera -- a 48-megapixel shooter -- offers fantastic results in good light with plenty of detail and pleasing colours. In low light, too, the camera offers excellent performance, keeping noise levels low and getting colours right. The wide-angle shooter -- based around a 50-megapixel sensor -- is too good when the light is ample. In low light, it does have noise in corners, but otherwise, it does manage to shoot pleasing photos. More significantly, we found that the tricks like 150-degree view, FishEye mode, and XPAN are fun to use and allow clicking of photos with a unique perspective."},

Deliveries increased slightly from the previous quarter’s 308,600 deliveries and outpaced the 184,800 shipments Tesla made in the first quarter, representing a 68 percent year-over-year increase. On the production side of things, Tesla managed to build a total of 305,407 vehicles."},

There are two large sensors on the front of the device to help avoid obstacles, as well as two downward-facing sensors to prevent ground collisions. If true, this is a welcome addition to the beginner-friendly drone series — the DJI Mini 2 only has ground detection sensors.In terms of its camera, the leak shows a lens with a maximum aperture of f/1.7, which should result in a brighter image and improved low-light performance when compared to the f/2.8 lens on the DJI Mini 2. The camera’s mounted to a redesigned three-axis gimbal that’s placed off to one side, potentially allowing users to shoot vertical videos suitable for posting on social platforms. The DJI Mini 3 Pro may have a slightly longer flight time, as the leak indicates an upgraded 2,453mAh battery. For comparison, the DJI Mini 2 has a 2,250 mAh battery and a flight time of 31 minutes, so we may see a small improvement with the Mini 3 Pro."},

That’s a fine and not-illegal thing for one non-doctor to ask another non-doctor. What is a HIPAA violation is what U.

After a patient left an anonymous, negative Google review, he logged on and responded with his own post on the Google page, saying that the patient missed scheduled appointments. “Does he deserve any rating as a patient? Not even one star,” Igbinadolor wrote, according to the notice of proposed determination outlining the violation. (For the curious, the redacted HIPAA-violating Google post is on page 3.) In the post, he used the patient’s full name and described, in detail, the specific dental problem he was in for: “excruciating pain” from the lower left quadrant, which resulted in a referral for a root canal. That’s what a HIPAA violation actually looks like. The law says that healthcare providers and insurance companies can’t share identifiable, personal information without a patient’s consent. In this case, the dentist (a healthcare provider) publicly shared a patient’s name, medical condition, and medical history (personal information). As a result, the office was fined $50,000.

The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, which enforces HIPAA, asked to see Igbinadolor’s office’s internal policies and procedures around personal health information and social media.
